**Seeding the Dta for REST API**
in the seeders we made some logic to make 200 users owning 200 events and make more users attending those events.
though adding the relation attendees which carries the user_id and the event_id to represents the users that attented to 
which event and that's many to many relation 
which the events can be attended by many users and the users can attend many events.

so for that we made special seeders for the events and the attendees we made a seeder to the event which  is called `EventSeeder` and its functionality is:
making events owned by some users.
and then make a Attend events which randomly takes ther users and making them attend randomly from 1 to 3 events for each user.
